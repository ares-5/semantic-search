### Query: walking of subjects after stroke or heart attack

BM25 (lexical search):
- P@10 = 0.30 → 3 out of 10 results were relevant.
- R@10 = 0.43 → Retrieved 43% of all relevant documents.
- nDCG@10 = 0.51 → Ranking quality is moderate; relevant docs not always at the top.

Semantic search:
- P@10 = 0.40 → 4 out of 10 were relevant (better than BM25).
- R@10 = 0.57 → Retrieved more relevant docs than BM25.
- nDCG@10 = 0.68 → Relevant results ranked higher than in BM25.

Hybrid (semantic + BM25 blend):
- P@10 = 0.40, R@10 = 0.57, nDCG@10 = 0.68 → Identical to semantic; fusion didn’t add value here.

Reranked (semantic candidates reranked with cross-encoder):
- P@10 = 0.60 → 6 out of 10 were relevant, a big jump in quality.
- R@10 = 0.86 → Almost all relevant documents captured.
- nDCG@10 = 0.89 → Very strong ranking; relevant docs are near the top.


### Query: genetic mutations associated with cancer progression

BM25 (lexical search):
- P@10 = 0.50 → 5 out of 10 were relevant, decent baseline.
- R@10 = 0.56 → Retrieved just over half of all relevant docs.
- nDCG@10 = 0.62 → Relevant docs appear but not perfectly ranked.

Semantic search:
- P@10 = 0.20 → Only 2 out of 10 relevant.
- R@10 = 0.22 → Very poor coverage.
- nDCG@10 = 0.17 → Ranking collapsed; relevant docs buried.

Hybrid (semantic + BM25 blend):
- P@10 = 0.40, R@10 = 0.44, nDCG@10 = 0.34 → Somewhat better than semantic alone but still worse than BM25.

Reranked (semantic candidates reranked with cross-encoder):
- P@10 = 0.90 → 9 out of 10 relevant.
- R@10 = 1.00 → Retrieved all relevant documents.
- nDCG@10 = 1.00 → Perfect ranking: all relevant docs at the very top.

*** While semantic embeddings alone failed to rank relevant biomedical documents highly,
using a cross-encoder to rerank BM25/semantic candidates rescued these relevant results, 
demonstrating the practical benefit of a multi-stage retrieval pipeline.
